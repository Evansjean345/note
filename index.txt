First I would start with the solution below: 
 
hello to all I hope you are well and that you have had a good week without further delay, I would like to know your progress vis-Ã -vis the course and how you are doing 
 
 << 10 to 15 minutes to know the progress of each >> 
 
Now depending on everyone's answers I would start by asking: 
 
If yes, what is blocking the learner's progress or what are the points that he did not understand and adapt my fixed expectations at the start for this course according to everyone's understanding and in case
I notice a learner who has a good understanding,I could also ask them to get closer so that they can talk to each other and learn from each other 


<< I note that this task will take me about 30 minutes because 
I would like to identify the shortcomings of each of my learners for the best help to have a solid foundation for the future >>

If not, we can move forward in the course and stay on the basic objectives that I was about to set:

Share my different expectations at the end of the session, such as the accomplishment of a certain task by each in order to verify their acquired competence president:
Make a brief review of the previous chapters before moving on to the next because from the point of view the repetition is educational

<< I note that this task will consist of a 30mn to 45mn max >>

Then after reviewing the different shortcomings of each one, we can start a 2h30 course of ours on the next chapters in order to show my learners how to find the right solutions, Note that this course will be divided into 1H of theory and 1H30 of practice
If we have time left we will continue I will decide to ask what are the points that they did not understand in this session depending on that I will prepare my next lesson


NB: I adapt my course to everyone's understanding because the objective is to teach them to learn on their own
